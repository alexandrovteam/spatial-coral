## How to reproduce the results of the study?

In order to reproduce the results from the study, one needs the Matlab software installed. This is an expensive software but can be provided to you through your University/institute.

### Download the scripts
1. Clone the repository or download all its files
2. Edit the parameters of the files run_RipleyK_KS.m and run_MoranI.m, in particular the folder where the models are located.

### Run the scripts
1. Start Matlab
2. Go to the FOLDER with the study files (where the file run_RipleyK_KS.m) is located, and evoke the scripts

     ```cd FOLDER
     run_RipleyK_KS
     run_MoranI'
     ```
